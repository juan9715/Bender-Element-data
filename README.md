This repository contains the files comprising the data used for the following articles:

Waves Velocity and Poisson Ratio in Loose Sandy Martian Regolith Under Low Stresses. Part 1: Experimental Investigation
Waves Velocity and Poisson Ratio in Loose Sandy Martian Regolith Under Low Stresses. Part 2: Theoretical Analysis

Waveform data is available as csv files organized in separate folders for each of the four samples involved

Each sample folder separates between P and S waves

File "DATOSX.txt" indicates the stress level associated to each file (i.e. line 5 indicates the stress level for the measurement in file "scope_0.5.csv")

Each file contains the oscilloscope record for the two channels used in the oscilloscope, and may be visualized in the software of preference of the user
